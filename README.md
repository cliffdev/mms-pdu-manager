# mms-pdu-manager
A simple Java library for parsing and composing PDUs

The code for this library was extracted from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and slightly modified to remove all Android-specific functionalities to make it platform-agnostic so that it can be used on any Java-based application.

This repository also contains a sample project that demonstrates how to parse and compose PDUs from and into byte arrays respectively.
